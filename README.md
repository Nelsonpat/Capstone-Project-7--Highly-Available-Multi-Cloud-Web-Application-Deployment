# Capstone-Project-7--Highly-Available-Multi-Cloud-Web-Application-Deployment

**Problem Statement:**

Building a highly available web application that is resilient to failures and accessible from multiple regions is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted service and a positive user experience. This project addresses the challenge of deploying a highly available web application on multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure or GCP) to leverage their global infrastructure and redundancy capabilities. By making the application multi-cloud enabled and globally available, organizations can enhance reliability, scalability, and performance while mitigating the risk of downtime due to regional outages.

**Objectives:**

-   Design and deploy a highly available web application architecture that spans multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure or GCP).
-   Utilize cloud-native services and features to achieve redundancy, scalability, and fault tolerance across different regions.
-   Implement global load balancing and traffic routing mechanisms to ensure optimal performance and availability for users worldwide.

**Focus Areas:**

-   Multi-cloud architecture design and deployment.
-   High availability principles and best practices.
-   Cloud-native services for redundancy and fault tolerance.
-   Global traffic management and load balancing.

**Deliverables**

-   Highly available web application deployed on multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
-   Architecture diagrams illustrating the multi-cloud deployment setup and redundancy mechanisms.
-   Documentation detailing the deployment process, configuration settings, and global traffic routing strategies.
-   Testing and verification report demonstrating the application's availability, scalability, and performance under different conditions.

**Tasks/Activities List**

**Research and Planning**

-   Research high availability architectures and best practices on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

-   Implement data replication and synchronization mechanisms for maintaining consistency across multi-cloud environments.

**Global Traffic Management Setup**

-   Configure global load balancing and traffic routing mechanisms to distribute user requests across multiple regions and cloud providers.
-   Utilize cloud-native services such as AWS Global Accelerator, Azure Traffic Manager, or GCP Traffic Director for efficient traffic management and failover handling.
-   Test the failover scenarios to ensure seamless transition between regions and cloud providers in case of failures or disruptions.

**Documentation and Reporting**

-   Document the multi-cloud architecture design, deployment process, and configuration settings for each cloud provider.
-   Provide architecture diagrams illustrating the redundancy mechanisms, failover strategies, and global traffic routing setup.
-   Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the project's objectives, methodologies, results, and recommendations for future enhancements.

**Success Metrics**

-   Successfully deployed highly available web application spanning multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
-   Redundancy and failover mechanisms implemented effectively to ensure continuous availability and fault tolerance.
-   Global traffic management setup enabling optimal performance and user experience for global users.

**Bonus Points**
